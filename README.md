# Project - Selenium
 This is the code storage for what I do in selenium python.
 For Browser automation, you can use this for controlling basic functions of some popular websites like Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook.

# Installation
 Have Python3 installed in your system to use this.
 Then Install seleium using pip.
 ```
 pip install -U selenium
 ```

 I have used chrome browser, so this is for using it with Google Chrome.
 Then install the chrome browser driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

 For using any other browser, change the webdriver.Chrome() to Webdriver.Firefox(), etc for other browsers and then get their respective browsers.

# Create Environment variables
 Create a .env file with the following data
 ```
 INSTA_PASSWORD = "your-insta-password"
 FB_PASSWORD = "your-fb-password"
 ```

# Using the codes
 The code is divided into cells, have the jupyter server installed so as to run the code in parts.
 To run the code:
 ```
 ctrl + Enter
 shift + Enter
 ```
